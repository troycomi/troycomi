## Troy Comi

### Research Software Engineer at Princeton University

As part of the [RSE group at Princeton](https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/services/research-software-engineering),
I specialize in refactoring legacy codebases for human population genetics analysis.

I like to
- Accelarate, improve efficiency and refactor code
  - Reimplement algorithms to improve memory usage, like in [IBDmix](https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/IBDmix)
  - Replace slow, non-pythonic code with compiled libraries, like in [introgression](https://github.com/troycomi/introgression)
- Use [snakemake](https://github.com/snakemake/snakemake) for reproducible workflows
  - Large genomics [analyses](https://github.com/troycomi/gtex-gatk4)
  - Reproduce published results with [codeocean](https://codeocean.com/capsule/7605004/tree/v1)
  - Answer questions on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/12373791/troy-comi)
- Develop useful tools
  - Better slurm efficiency reporting with [reportseff](https://github.com/troycomi/reportseff)
  - Linting non-inclusive language with [blocklint](https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/blocklint)
- Design and teach workshops
  - [snakemake](https://github.com/troycomi/snakemake-training)
  - [advanced command line tools](https://github.com/princetonuniversity/advanced-command-line)
- Improve research code through [repo reviews](https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/services/repo-review-consultations)
